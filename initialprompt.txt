 In this current directory "my-portfolio" there is a folder called docs that contains several PDFs. I want you to create me the shell of a portfolio for my personal brand . The intention of this portfolio is to really stand out for hiring managers and recruiters. The main page should have a little contact card with a picture of myself along with a bio and other details that would go on a resume or portfolio. there are 3 main categories of my projects "Software", "Mobile Apps" and "Data Analytics". Each project expose that I build out should include an image space, a description space and a github link space. create 3 for each category, i will change these around myself later. the file called "Applied_Rigor_Engineering_Brand_Identity_&_Design_System.pdf" has all the Visual elements and brand etc. layed out, please read this very deeply. The other documents are my target audience Avatars and diary entries from each one. Please build this in react.
