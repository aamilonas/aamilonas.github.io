# Claude Code Prompt — GitHub Portfolio Auto-Population

## Context
I have a live portfolio site (React/Next.js) already running. I need you to auto-populate my **Mobile Apps** page (and any other relevant project pages) with real data pulled from my GitHub repos. Here's a screenshot of the current page for reference — it uses dark card-based layouts with project thumbnails, descriptions, tech tags, and "View on GitHub" links.

## GitHub Repos to Add

## Requirements

### 1. Fetch Project Data from GitHub
- For each repo above, read the **README.md** via the GitHub API (or raw URL).
- Extract the following from each README:
  - **Project title** (from the H1 or repo name)
  - **Description**: Summarize the README into a **100–200 word** description. Keep it professional and highlight key features, metrics, and what makes the project notable.
  - **GIF(s)**: Find all `.gif` image URLs embedded in the README. These will be used for hover previews.
  - **Tech stack / tools used**: Look for any "Built With", "Tech Stack", "Dependencies" section, or parse the repo's `package.json`, `Podfile`, `build.gradle`, `pubspec.yaml`, or equivalent to extract frameworks, languages, and libraries (e.g., Swift, Firebase, SwiftUI, HealthKit, Flutter, React Native, etc.).
  - **GitHub URL**: The repo link itself.

### 2. Project Card Behavior
Each project should render as a card matching my existing design (dark background, rounded corners, blue accent tags). The card must include:
- **Thumbnail area**: Show the **first letter of the project name** as a fallback (like the current design). BUT — if GIFs were found in the README, on **mouse hover** over the card, play the first GIF as an animated preview in the thumbnail area. On mouse leave, return to the static fallback.
- **Title**: Bold, below the thumbnail.
- **Description**: The 100–200 word AI-generated summary.
- **Metric/feature tags**: Highlighted blue pill tags for key features or metrics pulled from the description (e.g., "Real-time sync", "94% accuracy"). Pick 2–3 standout items.
- **Tech stack tags**: Gray pill tags listing each technology/framework used.
- **"View on GitHub" button**: Links to the repo URL. Opens in a new tab.

### 3. Admin Dialog / Add Project UI
- Check if there's an existing admin dialog, form, or CMS mechanism in the codebase for adding projects manually.
- **If one exists**: Make sure it supports all the fields above (title, description, GIFs, tech tags, GitHub URL, category/page).
- **If one does NOT exist**: Create a simple admin dialog/modal component that lets me:
  - Paste a GitHub repo URL
  - Auto-fetch and populate all fields from the README
  - Edit any field before saving
  - Choose which portfolio page/category to add it to (Mobile Apps, Software, Data Analytics)
  - Save to the project data store (JSON file, database, or wherever projects are currently stored)

### 4. Data Storage
- Look at how projects are currently stored in the codebase (likely a JSON file, array of objects, or database).
- Add the new projects to that same data source in the same format.
- If no structured data source exists, create a `projects.json` (or similar) and refactor the page to read from it.

### 5. Matching Existing Design
- **Do not change the existing design system.** Match the current card style, typography, colors, spacing, and layout exactly.
- Keep the responsive 3-column grid layout.
- Maintain dark theme styling with blue accents for feature tags.

## Implementation Order
1. First, explore the codebase to understand the project structure, how pages are routed, and where project data lives.
2. Fetch and parse all README files from the repos listed above.
3. Generate summaries and extract metadata.
4. Add project data to the data store.
5. Implement GIF hover preview on cards.
6. Build or extend the admin dialog for future project additions.
7. Test that everything renders correctly and matches the existing design.

## Important Notes
- Do NOT break any existing projects already on the page — only ADD new ones.
- If you need a GitHub API token for rate limits, ask me before proceeding.
- Preserve all existing functionality (dark mode toggle, navigation, etc.).
